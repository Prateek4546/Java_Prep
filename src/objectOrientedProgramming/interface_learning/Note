What how why

    First Question is What is an Interface
==> interface in java are work as blueprint in java that have only abstract method that multiple  class  can implement

===> why can we  not create an object of abstract class





=>>>> What is a functional interface
      if a interface have only on abstract Method  then the interface in called functional interface.
      @FunctionalInterface keyword can be used at the top of interface (it is optional).
      in functional interface we can have 1 abstract method ans can have default and static methode and object class
      methode also.

=>>>> What is lambda Expression
      Lambda Expression is a way to implement the functional interface
